Greece has faced devastating wildfires in the last 24 years. The deadliest event on record occurred in 2018 near Athens, where 104 people tragically died in the coastal settlement of Mati. In terms of
area destroyed, the Municipality of Evros has suffered the most extensive forest loss, totaling 95,454 hectares, with a staggering 83% of that damage occurring during the 2023 fires. Significant
losses were also seen in 2021, when fires on the island of Evia burned 34,283 hectares of forest, accounting for 47% of the total area burned in Greece that year.
