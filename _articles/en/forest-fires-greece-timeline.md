In 2007, Greece experienced its worst year of wildfires, with 4% of the forested area destroyed, primarily in the region of Ilia. Recently, wildfires have been increasing in frequency: in 2021, 2% of the forested area burned, with Evia being the most affected region, while in 2023, an additional 3% was lost, with Evros suffering the greatest damage. These recurring disasters highlight the ongoing challenge of wildfires in Greece and the importance of intensifying prevention and response efforts.
